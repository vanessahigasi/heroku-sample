    <!--
        This way of setting up React is not usual, but it's an easy way to start.
        Usually you use the `create-react-app` tool.

    <!-- Don't use this in production: -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Add your components here -->
    <script type="text/babel" src="/components/App.js"></script>

<body>

<!-- React will insert (appendChild) the component you put below in ReactDOM.render -->
<div id="root"></div>

<script type="text/babel">

    // Here we tell React to write the component App in the container with id "root".
    ReactDOM.render(
        <App/>,
        document.getElementById('root')
    );

<!--
  Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
  It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

  Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
  https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

  In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
  https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

  You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
